<h1 class="bio-header center">A little about Löris</h1>
<p class="biography">
    Born in White Plains, New York, Löris became intrigued by the beauty of art and language at a very young age.
    Encouraged by her parents, she sought to not only be a viewer of original works, but also a creator.
    When she wasn't rough-housing with her three siblings, her love of both writing and drawing was cultivated and honed as a beloved past-time.
    It was not until Löris ventured to Georgia with her family in 2006, that she was exposed to different mediums of creativity in High School.
    Löris later attended Emory University to pursue a career in medicine but, was initially dejected to find that the Southern Ivy was dismantling
    many of its study programs—art among them. It was then that she found a passion for movement and decided to not only major in
    Neuroscience & Behavioral Biology; but also, add Dance & Movement Studies as a minor. Within this program, she was able to train in Ballet,
    Modern and Jazz alongside her younger brother and acted as both a performing artist and choreographer for the Dance Company in residence there.
    After earning her degree in 2015, Löris found she could not stand to give up her love of the arts in favor of a job in health care.
    Most recently, Löris is working on her first novel and aspires to commission artwork for use in her clothing line.
